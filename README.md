## Paper

Available soon.

## Supplemental materials

 * **Supplemental #1** : Available soon. This supplemental material provides semi-procedural texture synthesis results using our method and comparisons to state-of-the-art texture synthesis methods (detail: 11 different texture synthesis methods applied on all of our 138 textures database).
 * **Supplemental #2** : Available soon. This supplemental material provides additional results on: PPTBF parameters estimation (147 images), comparisons to noise by example (structure only), material synthesis results, and synthesis results with structure transitions.
 * **Supplemental #3** : Available soon. This supplemental material contains the database of binary structures used for the paper in full quality. Note that for reasons of terms of use, we do not provide all corresponding texture exemplars. The folder Structures contains manually segmented binary structures. The
 folder Structures_with_PPTBF contains manually segmented binary structures with estimated PPTBF
 parameters, that can be used for procedural structure synthesis.

## Code

### PPTBF: procedural stochastic structures

 The [PPTBF_Structures_Src](PPTBF_Structures_Src) directory contains code required to produce
 procedural binary structures from files of PPTBF parameters, and a real-time viewer to be able
 to design and edit PPTBF parameters interactively (works under Windows, Linux port soon).
 More tools to come (ex: PPTBF database generator, spanning the space of PPTBF parameters).
 
#### Tools
 
 Windows binaries are available [here](http://igg.unistra.fr/people/semiproctex/PPTBF_Structures_Bin.zip). We provide tools for experimenting with the PPTBF model:
 - [x] a real-time PPTBF viewer/designer [GPU-accelerated]
 - [x] a PPTBF synthesizer from a PPTBF parameter file [GPU-accelerated] (for procedural PPTBF and binary structures synthesis)
 - [ ] a PPTBF database generator [GPU-accelerated] (spanning space of parameters) [not yet...]

 Check [this file](PPTBF_file_format.txt) to get a description of the PPTBF file format.

### Semi-Procedural Texture Synthesis
 
 The [Semiproc_synthesis_Src](Semiproc_synthesis_Src) directory contains code required to synthesize
 textures from files of our semi-procedural texture synthesis parameters and PPTBF parameters (works under Windows, Linux port soon). Work in progress...
 
#### Tools
 
 * The [Semiproc_synthesis_Bin](http://igg.unistra.fr/people/semiproctex/Semiproctex_synthesis_Bin.zip) archive
 contains Windows binaries for our semi-procedural texture synthesis method. The program is able
 to reproduce our texture synthesis results (i.e. color images) of Supplemental material #1.
 We provide the binaries of our GPU implementation. Note that a software version will be
 made available soon (for reasons of intellectual property, the GPU code cannot be
 distributed).
 
 * Here is a beta version of our semi-procedural texture software synthesizer [Semiproctex_synthesis_CPU_Bin](http://igg.unistra.fr/people/semiproctex/SemiProcTex_synthesizerCPU_v100_beta.zip) (not GPU-accelerated). More info to come about available features and parameters description...
 
 Check [this file](semiProcTex_file_format.txt) to get a description of the semi-procedural texture file format. Work in progress...
 
 ## Data
 
 * The PPTBF parameters estimated from our database of manually segmented structures are available
 following [this link](http://igg.unistra.fr/people/semiproctex/PPTBF_Parameters_v2.zip). Note
 that this is an updated version that improves the parameter values provided with the Supplemental
 materials.
 
 * You will soon find a link to our database of PPTBF parameters. Our database of PPTBF is distributed in 93 files/banks according to combinations of values of point process "tiling types", window function "profil types" and feature function "mixture model" types (stored as ".txt" files), approximately 100 Mo. Then, intermediate PPTBF files are generated by spanning the space of continous PPTBF parameters [approximately 130 Go for 1.2 million images of PPTBF in .png format of dimension 400x400 pixels each].
  
 * Our database of semi-procedural synthesis used for the supplementals...
